    "Positions are represented as complex numbers (specifically, {a, b} tuples representing real and imaginary part). Moving can be done by addition: position + direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation of direction is implemented by means of multiplication of a direction vector by either i or -i (complex number multiplication by value within unit circle can be used to represent rotation). Because there is no particular need to have full complex multiplication merely for that - the only possible parameters are i and -i, itâ€™s special-cased for only those two parameters (makes code a little bit simplier). Much easier than implementing a state machine representing the directions and transitions between those."
