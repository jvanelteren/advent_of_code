This small project is meant for when you are doing past years of Advent of Code and want to see how fast you are solving the puzzles.

'Performance' is defined as how fast you are completing the puzzles compared to the number 100 finisher on the leaderboard. It's a pretty narrow definition, in the end it's just about if you are enjoying yourself solving the puzzles. So if you decide you don't care about completion times that's 100% fine!

But if you like the competitive side of things, just do this:

1) Put your personal scores in the personal_scores map. You have two options: 
  a) If you competed during the year: Copy the stats from your [personal stats page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/self), starting from the line with ---Part 1 on it
  b) If you didn't compete during the year. Mark your start time when you start the puzzle, just on a piece of paper. Make sure to note the time again when you finish part 1 and part 2. Then calculate the time to star 1 and both stars in your personal file. The format is DAY, TIME TO STAR 1, TIME TO BOTH STARS. The times are in minutes.
There are example files in the personal_scores map

3) (Optional if you want to add seasons after 2021). Adjust the year in populate_db_with_results.py and run it. It will populate the db with your personal scores

4) Play around with both analysis notebooks

Hope you enjoy it! Jesse
