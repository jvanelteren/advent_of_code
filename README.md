## Advent of Code
[The most wonderful time, every December since 2015](https://www.adventofcode.com). The order in which I did the competitions:
* 2018, initial try, horrible code, but very proud to have solved all the puzzles
* 2019, went better, started using git, and fairly confident of solving the puzzles
* 2017, directly done after 2019
* 2016, directly done after 2016
* 2020, tried to compete for LB, average placement about 1600. Tried to make the code nice.

### Usage
* Every year has a folder with notebooks in there. I've alternated between using .py files and jupyter notebooks. In addition, the input files are not availble, on request of Eric Wastl, the creator of AoC (too protect his hard work being used by copycats). No guarentees it solves for your input. Nowadays the code is most of the time pretty clean, but there are some days that it's still a mess.
* advent_of_code_trainer --> Util to compare your solving times with the LB
* advent_of_code_stats --> Some data science on the leaderboards. Will probably publish something close to December 2021
* aoc --> my personal library with helper functions, e.g. a BFS function, but also simple functions to convert items in a list to int recursively

### Thanks
Huge thanks to Eric Wastl and team for making [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com)
