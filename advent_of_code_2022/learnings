I like unpacking with *. You can unpack a set as well:
a, = set('A)
a == 'A'

Frozenset can be intersected and unioned etc, will produce new frozenset

High scores:
  
Well done:
1) Code with some more lines if you're sure that will work instead of using a 'nice language feature' you don't fully understand
2) Hardcoding with if statements if simply sometimes the best


To improve:
3) Doing all parts of the assignment: Forgot to divide a string length by 2
4) Ranges suck. Something with the pressure at 6:00?
5) Forgot about list('ABDC') is an option instead of ['A', 'B', 'C']
7)efaultdict can change size during iteration while looking up values that dont exist
16) when you use an index to count how many items of an iterator you have consumed, make sure to increase it when you consume. I only did it per falling tetris stone, but not how often the wind blowes
