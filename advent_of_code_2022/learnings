I like unpacking with *. You can unpack a set as well:
a, = set('A)
a == 'A'


High scores:
  
Well done:
1) Code with some more lines if you're sure that will work instead of using a 'nice language feature' you don't fully understand
2) Hardcoding with if statements if simply sometimes the best


To improve:
3) Doing all parts of the assignment: Forgot to divide a string length by 2
4) Ranges suck. Something with the pressure at 6:00?
5) Forgot about list('ABDC') is an option instead of ['A', 'B', 'C']
